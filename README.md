# HR Attrition DataEmployee Attrition Dashboard
# Project Overview
This project visualizes key insights regarding employee attrition by leveraging Excel Query, Power Pivot, and Python for data analysis. The primary objective of the project is to help HR teams identify trends and factors contributing to employee turnover, enabling them to implement data-driven retention strategies. The dataset contains detailed information about employee demographics, job roles, compensation, and satisfaction levels, all of which are analyzed to gain a comprehensive understanding of attrition within the organization.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,470 observations with multiple attributes, including:

- Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, and Number of Dependents.
- Job Details: Department, Job Role, Monthly Income, Business Travel, Years at Company, and Work Experience.
- Satisfaction & Performance: Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Performance Rating, and Attrition Status (Yes/No).
- Tools Used
1. Excel Query:

- Used for importing, cleaning, and transforming the data from various sources.
- Enabled the merging and filtering of data for effective analysis.
2. Power Pivot:

- Created relationships between tables and implemented calculated columns to aggregate data efficiently.
- Used for building complex pivot tables and calculations that feed into visualizations.
3. Python:

- Employed for initial data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib were used to clean the data, identify key trends, and visualize data distributions before feeding it into Excel.
## Dashboard Features
1. Total Employees and Attrition Rate:

- Total Employees: Displays the total number of employees and the number of employees who have left the company.
- Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees who left the organization.
2. Attrition by Gender:

- A bar chart visualizing attrition rates for male and female employees, helping identify gender-related attrition trends.
3. Attrition by Department:

- A pie chart showcasing which departments (e.g., Sales, Research & Development, Human Resources) have the highest turnover rates.
4. Attrition by Job Role:

- A horizontal bar chart showing the attrition rates by specific job roles, highlighting positions with the highest retention challenges.
5. Attrition by Education Level:

- Visualizes the attrition rates based on employee education levels (e.g., Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree, etc.).
6. Attrition by Monthly Income:

- Displays how different income brackets correlate with employee turnover, providing insights into the relationship between compensation and attrition.
7. Attrition by Age Group and Gender:

- A breakdown of attrition by age groups and gender, helping identify which demographic groups have higher attrition rates.
8. Attrition by Job Satisfaction:

- Shows how employee satisfaction levels impact attrition, with low satisfaction correlating to higher turnover.
9. Attrition by Years of Service:

- Visualizes how the number of years an employee has worked in the company influences their likelihood of leaving.
10. Attrition by Marital Status:

- Displays the relationship between marital status (Single, Married, Divorced) and attrition.
## Analytical Insights
The analysis of the HR attrition data revealed several key insights:

- High Attrition in Sales: Employees in the Sales department show significantly higher attrition rates compared to other departments.
- Impact of Income: Employees earning within lower income brackets show a higher tendency to leave the company.
- Job Satisfaction Correlation: Lower job satisfaction is strongly correlated with higher attrition, emphasizing the importance of employee engagement.
- Age and Attrition: Younger employees, particularly those between the ages of 26-35, are more likely to leave than older employees.
## Conclusion
By integrating Excel Query and Power Pivot with Python, this dashboard allows HR professionals to gain valuable insights into employee attrition trends. It empowers data-driven decision-making, helping identify at-risk employees and developing retention strategies tailored to their specific needs. This project demonstrates how simple but powerful tools like Excel, combined with Python for preprocessing, can create impactful business solutions.
